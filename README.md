ResoDrive is a small Windows tray app for storage that normally lives in a browser
or command line. Connect Nextcloud, WebDAV, or SFTP, choose a drive letter, and use
the storage from Explorer. Closing the window does not interrupt active mounts or
transfers.

## What it does

- Mount Nextcloud, WebDAV, and SFTP storage in Explorer.
- Use passwords or SFTP private keys without putting credentials in profiles.
- Choose which drives mount at sign-in and how they reconnect.
- Run one-way copy or mirror jobs with readable progress and recent results.
- Keep credentials encrypted for your Windows account and rclone isolated from any
  system installation.
- Recover from background interruptions and unreliable connections automatically.

It runs on 64-bit Windows 11 and [supported Windows 10 LTSC or Enterprise releases](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/windows#supported-versions)
as old as version 1809. The setup program installs the .NET 10 Desktop Runtime
only when it is missing. Mounting a drive requires
[WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/); copy and mirror jobs do not.

## Install

Download `ResoDrive-Setup.exe` from the latest
[release](https://github.com/alphasixtyfive/resodrive/releases/latest), run it,
and open ResoDrive. The first time through:

1. Let ResoDrive download and verify rclone.
2. Add your storage connection and choose a free drive letter.
3. If you want a mounted drive, install WinFsp when prompted.

Your settings, encrypted credentials, logs, cache, and managed rclone copy live in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\rdrive`. An upgrade leaves that folder alone. After the first
install, you can check for and install ResoDrive updates from Settings.
Application and rclone downloads can continue from a partial file after a dropped
connection, which avoids starting large transfers again on metered or satellite links.

<details>
<summary><strong>Deployment profiles</strong></summary>

You do not need a profile file for personal use. ResoDrive opens with manual setup
when no `profiles.json` is present.

For a team deployment, start with [`profiles.sample.json`](profiles.sample.json),
add the connection presets you want to offer, and save the result as:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\rdrive\profiles.json
```

Profiles are for connection details and defaults. Do not put passwords, tokens, or
private keys in them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source</strong></summary>

Install the .NET 10 SDK, then run:

```powershell
dotnet test resodrive.slnx --configuration Release
.\build.ps1
```

The verified setup executable, MSI, and portable package are written to
`artifacts\win-x64`. The app is framework-dependent to keep downloads small; the
setup executable handles the runtime prerequisite for new installations.
